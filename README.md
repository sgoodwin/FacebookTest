My assignment was as follows:

Project: Facebook Integration with SSO
Write a little app that lets you login to Facebook and extract the following data:
- List of friends, profile pic, first and last name.  Please display all these attributes as cells in a UITableView
- Get the app to post notifications on your behalf
- Get the app to access my wall (Steven Lammertink)
- Extra credit: When a user table cell is selected, show a UIMapView and show a pin where the last known location for that user was.
